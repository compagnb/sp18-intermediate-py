### Course Breakdown:

#### [Week 1: Classes & Objects](week1.md)
* Children & Parents
* Adding Objects to Classes
* Adding Class Characteristics as Functions
* Inherited Functions
* Functions Calling Functions
* Initializing An Object
* In-class Exercises/Challenges: 
    * Create a class that can be used for all the drivers used in Mario Kart
    * Create a class that can be used for all the karts used in Mario Kart
    * Using the turtle class create a generative/fractal design
    * Create a class that provides methods for drawing the following shapes: Square, Circle, Octagon, Pentagon.
    * Modify the shapes class to allow for the options of changing the fill color, border, size, etc.
    * Create a class to build a Maze.

#### Week 2: Key-binding & Basic Sprites
* Review
* Using Graphics
* loading/formating
* background/sprite
* Objects & Classes in Pictures
* Key Binding methods
* In-class Exercise/Challenges
    * Create a “Player” class that allows a user to navigate the maze created last week.
    * Create a “Player” class that controls a spaceship on the screen. (beginning of alternative version of space invaders)
    * Use Player class to create a 2 player game that controls 2 different spaceships on the screen.
    * Limit the players movement to the viewable screen size/maze boundaries.

#### Week 3: Modules
* Review of Built-in Functions/Modules
    * abs, bool, dir, eval, exec, float, int, len, max, min, range, sum
    * Random - randint, choice, shuffle
    * Sys - exit shell, reading and writing stdin/stdout objects
    * Time - convert asctime, localtime, sleep
    * Math
    * Url
    * Json
* Creating A Custom Module
* In-class Exercise/Challenges:
    * Modify the player class from last week to a module
    * Create a module and class for invaders that move around the screen at various speeds, change directions when they hit the edge of the viewable space on the screen & have the option of looking differently.
    * From the invader module, create 20 invaders on the screen. (long method)

#### Week 4: Object Arrays & Collision Detection
* Review
* Array Basics
* Index
* Printing
* Iteration using loops
* Operations
* Collision Detection
* Pythagorean Theorem
* Math module
* Collision detection within objects within arrays.
* In-class Exercise/Challenges:
    * Create a module to include a score that is viewable on the screen.
    * Create an array of invaders that move, within the screen (short method)
    * Create a function to calculate if there has been a collision between the player’s spaceship and an invader. 
    * Modify the “space invader” code to change the score when there has been a collision.

#### Week 5: Push/Pull/Encryption Data (Database/file read/write & custom encryptions)
* Review
* Maps
* Using Arrays to populate Maps
* Creating/Opening/Writing To Files
* Copy - make copies
* Keyword - keep track of keywords
* Pickle - saving
* In-class Exercise/Challenges:
    * Mystery Code
    * A Hidden Message
    * Copying A File
    * Guess The Number
    * Build high score component

#### Week 6: Using API & Real-time Data (Scraping & Mining) 
* URLIB
* JSON
* In-class Exercise/Challenges:
    * Using Weather Data to modify Game

#### Week 7: Better Graphics Using Tkinter
* Clickable Button
* Named Parameters
* Canvas & Drawing
* Text
* Images
* In-class Exercise/Challenges:


#### Week 8: Machine Learning 
* Animation
* Object Reaction
* In-class Exercise/Challenges:
