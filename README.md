### Course Breakdown:

#### [Week 1: Review](wkNotes/wk1Rev.md)
#### [Week 1: Classes & Objects](wkNotes/wk1.md)
* Adding Objects to Classes
* Adding Class Characteristics as Functions
* Functions Calling Functions
* Initializing An Object
* **In-class Exercises/Challenges**: 
    * Create a program to calculate our weight on the moon (or any planet):
        * Create function to take the starting weight and increase the weight each year
        * Modify the function so that you can change the amount of years
        * Take input from the user for each and then display how much the user would weigh
    * Create a class named Giraffe. 
        * Give the class functions that represent things a giraffe would do. (i.e. eat, sleep, left foot forward, right foot forward, etc.)
        * Make a function within the Giraffe class to make the giraffe dance by calling other functions within the class. 
        * Make an instance of the Giraffe, and make the instance dance.
        * Make two instances and make them both do different things. 
        * Make two instances of the Giraffe class, that have a different number of spots (characteristics).
    * Create a class that can be used for all the drivers used in Mario Kart
    * Create a class that can be used for all the karts used in Mario Kart
* **Vocabulary**: class, initialize, instance, object
* **Keywords**: class, pass 


#### [Week 2: Classes Continued...](wkNotes/wk2Rev.md)
#### [Week 2: Key-binding & Basic Sprites](wkNotes/wk2.md)
* Children & Parents
* Inherited Functions
* Using Graphics
* loading/formating
* background/sprite
* Objects & Classes in Pictures
* Key Binding methods
* **In-class Exercises/Challenges**: 
    * Using the turtle class create a generative/fractal design
    * Create a class that provides methods for drawing the following shapes: Square, Circle, Octagon, Pentagon.
    * Modify the shapes class to allow for the options of changing the fill color, border, size, etc.
    * Create a class to build a Maze.
    * Create a “Player” class that allows a user to navigate the maze created last week.
    * Create a “Player” class that controls a spaceship on the screen. (beginning of alternative version of space invaders)
    * Use Player class to create a 2 player game that controls 2 different spaceships on the screen.
    * Limit the players movement to the viewable screen size/maze boundaries.
* **Vocabulary**: child, parent 
* **Keywords**: 


#### Week 3: Modules
* Review of Built-in Functions/Modules
    * abs, bool, dir, eval, exec, float, int, len, max, min, range, sum
    * Random - randint, choice, shuffle
    * Sys - exit shell, reading and writing stdin/stdout objects
    * Time - convert asctime, localtime, sleep
    * Math
    * Url
    * Json
* Creating A Custom Module
* In-class Exercise/Challenges:
    * Modify the player class from last week to a module
    * Create a module and class for invaders that move around the screen at various speeds, change directions when they hit the edge of the viewable space on the screen & have the option of looking differently.
    * From the invader module, create 20 invaders on the screen. (long method)

#### Week 4: Object Arrays & Collision Detection
* Review
* Array Basics
* Index
* Printing
* Iteration using loops
* Operations
* Collision Detection
* Pythagorean Theorem
* Math module
* Collision detection within objects within arrays.
* In-class Exercise/Challenges:
    * Create a module to include a score that is viewable on the screen.
    * Create an array of invaders that move, within the screen (short method)
    * Create a function to calculate if there has been a collision between the player’s spaceship and an invader. 
    * Modify the “space invader” code to change the score when there has been a collision.

#### Week 5: Push/Pull/Encryption Data (Database/file read/write & custom encryptions)
* Review
* Maps
* Using Arrays to populate Maps
* Creating/Opening/Writing To Files
* Copy - make copies
