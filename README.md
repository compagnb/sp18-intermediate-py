•	Password Protected High Score

Course Breakdown:

Week 1: Classes & Objects
•	Children & Parents
•	Adding Objects to Classes
•	Adding Class Characteristics as Functions
•	 Inherited Functions
•	Functions Calling Functions
•	Initializing An Object
•	In-class Exercises/Challenges: 
o	Create a class that can be used for all the drivers used in Mario Kart
o	Create a class that can be used for all the karts used in Mario Kart
o	Using the turtle class create a generative/fractal design
o	Create a class that provides methods for drawing the following shapes: Square, Circle, Octagon, Pentagon.
o	Modify the shapes class to allow for the options of changing the fill color, border, size, etc.
o	Create a class to build a Maze.

Week 2: Key-binding & Basic Sprites
•	Review
•	Using Graphics
o	loading/formating
o	background/sprite
•	Objects & Classes in Pictures
•	Key Binding methods
•	 In-class Exercise/Challenges
o	Create a “Player” class that allows a user to navigate the maze created last week.
o	Create a “Player” class that controls a spaceship on the screen. (beginning of alternative version of space invaders)
o	Use Player class to create a 2 player game that controls 2 different spaceships on the screen.
o	Limit the players movement to the viewable screen size/maze boundaries.

Week 3: Modules
•	Review
•	Review of Built-in Functions/Modules
o	 abs, bool, dir, eval, exec, float, int, len, max, min, range, sum
o	Random - randint, choice, shuffle
o	Sys - exit shell, reading and writing stdin/stdout objects
o	Time - convert asctime, localtime, sleep
o	Math
o	Url
o	Json
•	Creating A Custom Module
•	In-class Exercise/Challenges:
o	Modify the player class from last week to a module
o	Create a module and class for invaders that move around the screen at various speeds, change directions when they hit the edge of the viewable space on the screen & have the option of looking differently.
o	From the invader module, create 20 invaders on the screen. (long method)

Week 4: Object Arrays & Collision Detection
•	Review
•	Array Basics
o	Index
o	Printing
o	Iteration using loops
o	Operations
•	Collision Detection
o	Pythagorean Theorem
o	Math module
o	Collision detection within objects within arrays.
•	In-class Exercise/Challenges:
o	Create a module to include a score that is viewable on the screen.
o	Create an array of invaders that move, within the screen (short method)
o	Create a function to calculate if there has been a collision between the player’s spaceship and an invader. 
o	Modify the “space invader” code to change the score when there has been a collision.

Week 5: Push/Pull/Encryption Data (Database/file read/write & custom encryptions)
•	Review
•	Maps
•	Using Arrays to populate Maps
•	Creating/Opening/Writing To Files
o	Copy - make copies
o	Keyword - keep track of keywords
•	Pickle - saving
